                                    <p class="mb-4">The first majro task of the semester was to build a Prusa Mini+ in pairs and document the journey. Once finished, a Benchy 3d Model was printed as a benchmark.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first steps of the handbook outline all of the resources you may need - for example, it highlights which tools are needed, shows how to use the part "cheatsheet" that came with the printer, and gave several ways to reach out to support. This part was useful in preparing the setup as it helped keep things organized.
                                    <br>
                                    The professors of the course also made it a point to organize all the pieces in the box before attempting to build the printer. This helped making look for pieces substantially easier and it meant that it would be harder to lose pieces or mix pieces with the other groups.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/prusa1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <i>All of the pieces laid out</i>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first steps - steps 6 through 10 - were very easy and just involved recognizing which parts are the XYZ-axes, in addition to placing foam blocks on them. Step 11 and 12, connecting the LCD cable, proved to be a little difficult. Placing the LCD cable was hard because it was in a particularly tight corner, meaning that one's fingers wouldn't reach completely in the box. Additionally, the hole one feeds the LCD cable through was not in place with where the cable was. This meant that I had to bend the LCD cable at a 45 degree angle to get it in.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Steps 13-18 involved joining both the Y and XZ-axis together. The connection was formed by screwing them together using M3nE nuts, which can be found on the machine. They are shown in the picture below, on the left.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/prusa2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    This was the step we got the most wrong. The instruction manual doesn't give an exact picture or instruction on where to place the M3nE nuts; it only says "Place the right M3nE nut approximately in the middle of the extrusion length, but make sure it is not under the heatbed structure." This made it so that we ultimately placed it too far back the first time and then too far back the second time. 
                                    <br>
                                    Aside from that, joining the parts together and screwing them in was fairly easy.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/prusa3.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Steps 20-22 had to do with the LCD screen. Setting it up and getting it mounted onto the printer was very easy, and there's not much to comment, save for one important problem. 
                                    <br>
                                    Because of the aforementioned problem with the M3nE nut, the LCD was placed too far forward at first. When running calibration, the nozzle and the Y-axis actually ran into the LCD screen, preventing it from moving a far down as it should have. This was fixed by later moving the M3nE nuts. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Steps 23-29 dealt with the cables and other electronics, such as the filament sensor. Connecting the cables was easy. My partner struggled with them initially, but the printer uses multi pin connectors, which computers also use. I have experience putting together PCs, so it wasnt too difficult to put them into place. I'm sure my partner would also have gotten it if given enough time.

                                    <i>Not the same exact cables, but a similar style</i>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Steps 31-36 dealt with assembling the spool. This was, by far, the easiest part of the whole process. This is because one did not have to bend their fingers around corners, deal with cable management, or anything more complicated than screwing screws and bearings into place.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/prusa6.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The final two steps, 38-39, involved connecting the power supply and the PEI MINI sheet, which is the surface where objects are 3D printed.

                                    <b>Benchy 3D Model</b>

                                    <br>
                                    Due to finishing the Prusa Mini+ right as class ended, there wasn't any time left to calibrate and make sure it was printing correctly. Because of this, the Benchy was printed next class. The goal of the second class was to print the Benchy as fast as possible - my pair and I opted to do this by reducing the size. This resulted in a print of about 30 minutes.
                                    <br>
                                    Seeing as this gave us ample time to print a regular sized one as well, one was also printed with an increased z-axis layer size. This reduced the detail of the benchmark, but it succeeded in getting it print in under an hour.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/prusa8.jpg" alt="..." />

                                    <br>
                                    Seen on the smaller benchy clearly and also present in the actual benchy in the background is a large amount of stringing. We were told that it may be because the filament chosen has a high amount of moisture. While that may be the case, switching the retraction settings, notably increasing the retraction speed, and turning on a setting specifically made to reduce stringing helped greatly in future prints, though it was not eliminated entirely.
                                    <br>
                                    In future projects, I have made some further efforts to help with any errors. For one, I run the first layer calibration before starting a print on a printer I haven't used before. Additionally, I've begun wiping down the bed with the alcohol wipes that came with the Prusa Mini+. This eliminates any oil that may be left from touching the heat bed.

                                    <b>Concluding Thoughts</b>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A lot was learned from this process. Since I had not thought about it much, I assumed that 3D printers were very much a "plug n chug" device that did not require calibration. Though there has been leaps and bounds in recent years in 3D printer technology, it still requires a lot of attention, especially when it comes to printing settings. Because of this, some view it as a different form of art - one that requires experience and creative thinking to approach. 
                                    <br> Something I further explored after this was the amount of detail the printer could ouput. This thought came as a result of the mini Benchy that was 50% the size of the larger one. I still don't have enough experience to be able to definitively say so, and in the future I would like to mess around with settings more, but for now, it seems as though FDM printers may not excel at detail at a small scale. This is also what I managed to find online. I printed a very small miniature to test the limits of the printer, and though the limits are clearly visible, it managed to make the figure somewhat distinguishable. Given that it produced this when I scarcely tinkered with the settings, I would say the printer doesn't fail on a minute scale either.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Project 2 consisted of remixing an existing design or mixing two together. I decided to put together these two designs;
                                        <br>https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hsidgKbdRPl-dice-jar
                                        <br>https://www.models-resource.com/pc_computer/zootycoon2/model/16507/
                                        <br>
                                        <br><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/redpanda.jpg" alt="..." />
                                        <br>I would have liked to sketch the dimensions to get a more accurate measurement of how to make the lid bigger, but I couldn't use TinkerCAD to take precise measurements. In the future, I plan on using Fusion360 to be able to sketch and plan things better ahead of time. However, this did present a unique opportunity to print with a more "feel-based" approach instead of trying to be analytic. This would be useful later when I 3d printed an elbow joint - though not included here as it was more for practice than for this project, it was helpful because you almost have to guess (at least at first) how much smaller to make a pin than the hole it goes into.
                                        <br>
                                        <br><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/panda3.png" alt="..." />
                                        <br>The jar stayed the same for the most part, but I redid the lid, shown in the picture above. There's some things to note; for one, the original lid wasn't made that well in TinkerCAD. Essentially, the lid that came with the original Dice Jar design had a hole in it that I did not notice until I 3d printed it;
                                        <br><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/panda2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                        <br>That being said, there were some preemptive measures I attempted to take. Some peers had experince with TinkerCAD trying to print things in midair. To remedy this issue, I almost sunk the figure in a bit deeper into the lid to make sure that it would stick. I also made sure to use the "hole" tool to encapsulate any bits left midair, one of which existed due to me bending the tail of the red panda.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>There was something else, though, that affected my final print, and it actually came from the concept phase. When finding 3D models, I obtained one from a video game called Zoo Tycoon 2, released in 2004. As you can see in the TinkerCAD model picture previously, this resulted in a really polygonal and blocky panda. Video games, especially old ones, have restraints when it comes to the amount of polygons they can use - in fact, most of the depth comes from the texture files that are applied to the models. This means that they aren't always the best choices to 3D print, as video games have to use a lot of tricks to conserve memory usage.
                                        <br><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/panda1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                        <br>Above is the picture of the finished print. Another thing of note is how the lid was oriented to print. Normally, I could print this lid without supports - imagining the red panda isn't there, I would flip it 180 degrees and it would be almost entirely hassle-free. However, the inclusion of the figurine makes this option a bit less desirable - analyzing it in Meshmixer showed this to be the best orientation. Regardless, there is also the problem of supports being printed onto and around the figurine that could make it difficult to remove without accidentally messing with a piece.
                                        <br>If I did this project without the specific guidelines of needing to combine two objects, I would print the figurine separately and glue it on - I feel like there would be less room for error there.
                                        <video width="500px" height="500px" controls="controls">

                                    </video>
                                        <br>That being said, a place where I found success was in changing the support settings and making them easier to take off. I achieved this by using a 0.4mm offset in the support settings, which made them much less resistant to being taken off. Additionally, I later made the diameter larger and would manually remove them in order to remove unnecessary supports. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>One thing I could have done to increase the detail in the figurine is to lower the layer size. It likely would have come out looking better, but it increased the time by a lot. I ended up not doing this because it would have reduced the layer size for the whole lid - I am not comfortable modifying g-code to change printer settings midway through just yet, but it may be an option in the future. Something else that came up is that the lid would also not fit very stable on the jar - it would not squeeze on, and it would pop out very easily.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> There are several ways to address this. One unique way may be to use a more flexible material that doesn't resist bending as much - it would almost be like a tupperware lid. That being said, it would be best to prototype this solution with PLA and ensure it is the right size beforehand.
                                        <br>Another solution is to simply make the lid larger. PLA tends to change while cooling, which can make parts that are supposed to fit perfectly <i>not do that</i>. By making the lid 5% or 10% larger, I would be able to ensure that it stays on - it may take a fair bit of experimenting to get it just right, though, and it would be worth thinking about how to expedite this process so it doesn't take 5 hours to print each prototype. One possible way of doing is would be to just print a very small cross-section of the lid without the figurine and all of the lip part of the lid. In the future, I will be sure to prototype more before committing to a whole print.

                                    <p class="mb-4">The goal of the alarm clock project was to learn how to solder and create an item in Fusion 360 that would fit the measured dimensions of the circuit board.
                                        <br>
                                    The first step of the project involved soldering the circuit board to get the alarm clock to function. My partner and I followed multiple steps when soldering. Once heated, we would put a good amount of solder on the tip of the iron while continuously cleaning it. After this, we would place the tip near the area we wanted to solder. We would feed solder into the area and, once it seemed like there was enough, we would lift the tip to create a peaked shape. Some pictures of these steps are included below;
                                    <br>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder3.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <br>
                                    There were two problems we experienced, which were at complete opposite ends of the spectrum - too much solder and not enough solder. The first time around, my partner wasn't using enough solder. This is because they were using another method as opposed to the one described above. They would put solder on the tip of the iron away from the circuit board, then bring it close and try to "paint" it on. The second time around, I tried to overcompensate for the amount of solder and ended up putting too much on some, which meant that the soldered points would reach up a bit high. We managed to fix this.
                                    <br>Our first circuit didn't work due to a burned point on the board. Though we attempted to fix this, what we ultimately did was solder another board. The second board did work and gave us almost no problems - the only issue we had was forgetting to place the chip in, and that was easily resolved.
                                    <br>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder4.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <br>
                                    The second step in this project was to measure the circuit board in order to make measurements. Using digital calipers, some measurements were taken, such as: the width between the buzzer and buttons, the width between the displays, the length, height, and depth of the circuit board as a whole, and more. Here is a diagram showing some of the measurements taken;
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder5.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <br>
                                    From there, we tried to translate this into Fusion 360. At first, we created a simple box just to make sure we had the correct measurements.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder6.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    These are some of the early prototypes we used before finishing up with the final version. The idea of the box was to have a front face that could fit into a back container. The top-most piece was an early version of the back. Originally, we were trying to decide whether the circuit would face the bigger piece or the smaller piece (which is why the back lid has a whole in this version). Eventually, we decided it would be easier to take measurements for the smaller piece since it almost exactly fit the circuit-board. The second piece was to see how the circuit board would fit if the larger lid was the face of the alarm clock.
                                    <br>The third piece down is an attempt at bringing the measurements from paper to real life. It didn't match up as well, but with some minor adjustments, we got it to where it is now. Finally, the bottom right piece was made with these adjustments. I realized that I didn't need to print the entire box, so I only printed some layers to see if it lined up well.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The slicer settings were kept the same as they were on the Prusa Slicer 0.20mm QUALITY default settings with the exception of adding organic supports. This ended up working fine. 
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/solder7.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/alarmclock.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    Our final product looks like this. It has a hole at the back to allow the battery to be plugged in. It's a very simple fit, and not extraordinarily tight. Something I would like to experiment more with in the future would be a system to attach the object. Whether through a hook and rod or a pin-slot system, it would be interesting to have a more secure fit. An alternative would have been combining these two pieces and instead making a hole in the top; this way, one could make a "lip" that can be lifted.
